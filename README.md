# Customer Churn Prediction Project  

In today's competitive business environment, customer retention is essential for sustainable growth and success. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify customers who are at risk of churning (discontinuing their use of our service). Customer churn can result in significant revenue loss and a decline in market share. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to proactively target high-risk customers with personalized retention strategies to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and optimize business strategies.

## Problem Statement  

Customer churn prediction involves analyzing customer data to determine the likelihood of a customer discontinuing service. The goal is to create a robust predictive model using historical usage behavior, demographic information, and subscription details to proactively address churn risks. This will enable the business to foster customer loyalty and engagement, contributing to long-term success.

## Data Description  

The dataset consists of customer information with the following attributes:  

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.  
- **Name**: Name of the customer.  
- **Age**: Age of the customer.  
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male or Female).  
- **Location**: Customer's location (e.g., Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, New York).  
- **Subscription_Length_Months**: Number of months the customer has been subscribed.  
- **Monthly_Bill**: Monthly bill amount.  
- **Total_Usage_GB**: Total usage in gigabytes.  
- **Churn**: Binary indicator (1 = churned, 0 = not churned).
