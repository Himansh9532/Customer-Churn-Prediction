# 📊 **Customer Churn Prediction Project**  

In today’s competitive market, retaining customers is critical to success. Losing customers, also known as **churn**, can lead to revenue loss and reduced market share. This project leverages **machine learning** to build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning. By targeting these customers with personalized retention strategies, businesses can enhance satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and drive growth.
